# Home-Office

## Introduction
This project aims to explore and predict employee preferences between 'home office' and 'physical attendance' work regimes using various features related to their characteristics and working patterns. The motivation behind this project stemmed from personal curiosity and the desire to enhance classification modeling skills while addressing a relatable real-life question: Is it better to work from home or go into the office?

## Background
As the modern work landscape evolves, the choice between remote work and in-office attendance has become a significant consideration for both employees and employers. Factors like commute time, work-life balance, productivity, and personal preferences contribute to this decision-making process. The project dataset was carefully chosen to simulate this real-world dilemma and to exercise classification techniques in solving practical problems.

## Dataset
The dataset contains a collection of employee data points, each described by a set of features including demographic information, job role, commuting details, personal preferences, and more. The target variable is the work regime preference: 'home office' or 'physical attendance'. This data was collected with the intention to explore patterns and build a predictive model that can help individuals and organizations understand the factors influencing this crucial decision.

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between features. Identify potential patterns that might influence work regime preferences.

Feature Engineering: Select and preprocess relevant features, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables appropriately for input into classification models.

Classification Modeling: Develop and evaluate various classification algorithms to predict an employee's preferred work regime. Compare model performances and select the most suitable one.

Model Interpretation: Use techniques such as feature importance analysis to understand which factors play a significant role in predicting work regime preferences.

Project Documentation: Create clear and concise documentation including this README, code comments, and explanatory notebooks to facilitate understanding and collaboration.

## Conclusion
By applying classification techniques to this employee work regime preference dataset, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing individuals' choices between 'home office' and 'physical attendance'. The project's code, analysis, and findings contribute not only to enhancing classification skills but also to addressing a relevant topic in the modern work landscape.
